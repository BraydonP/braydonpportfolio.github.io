							<li>Astralis have now won two majors together as a lineup (back to back). For Gla1ve, Xyp9x, dupreeh, and device this is their third Major title. So far no player has won more than three majors.</li>
							<li>In these two Major victories, Astralis has not dropped a single map in playoffs. At IEM Katowice Astralis 2-0'd NiP, MIBR, and ENCE. At the FACEIT Major they 2-0'd FaZe, Liquid, and Na`Vi. Actually, Astralis has only dropped 3 maps out of 25 in total in these last two Majors they have won in a row.</li>
							<li>Astralis has now been to 18 LAN events as a lineup. They've made 14 Finals, won 11 of them, and only placed outside of the top 4 one time (their first event together at StarLadder Season 4).</li>
							<li>One of the Astralis' top 4 finishes and the top 8 finish were in their first two events. So actually, made 14 finals and won 11 titles in their last 16 events. Astralis won 4 events in a row before losing to Liquid at IBP and have won the last 7 out of 9 events they've attended. (Won last 2 seasons of EPL/ECS, Won last 2 Majors, etc.).</li>
							<li>Since winning Dreamhack Masters Marseille, their 3rd LAN together, Astralis have never failed to follow up a lost tournament by winning the next one. They've bounced back five times. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Thooorin/status/1102312668705243137" target="blank">This one is from Thorin</a>)</li>
							<li>Astralis led 2018 in almost all team categories and they still are in 2019. This includes, RW% [especially CT side], success in opening duels, 5v4% conversion, 4v5% conversion, and utility damage.</li>
							<li>All of the Astralis players were ranked in the top 15 in overall HLTV rating for 2018 offline. If you count ties for rating 4 are in top 10 (device #2, dupreeh #5 [tied with electronic and cold], Magisk #6 [tied with nathE], gla1ve #8). Xyp9x is #11. This is based on filtering for LAN 2018 and Top 30. All in HLTV Top 20 (Within top 15). All playing great this year as well.</li>
							<li>In the 18 events Astralis has attended, device has won 7 HLTV MVP Awards, dupreeh has won 1 HLTV MVP Award, and Magisk has won 2 HLTV MVP Awards (Xyp9x was super close to Magisk on getting it for IEM Katowice 2019).</li>
							<li>Astralis have only lost 10 bo3/bo5 series out of ~57! (I manually counted so I could be off by 1 or 2). So they have won 82% of the bo3/bo5 series they have played offline.</li>
